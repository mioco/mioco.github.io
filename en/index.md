#### ByteDance  
##### TikTok - Growth - Paid Acquisition (2022‚ÄìPresent)  

Responsible for driving global user growth for TikTok through paid acquisition channels, including mobile pre-installs and marketing campaigns, with a focus on increasing DAU and new user acquisition. Collaborated with the E-Commerce and Ads teams to optimize operational costs.

- Led the architectural design and implementation of hybrid C-end applications, ensuring scalability, performance, and a seamless user experience. Supported large-scale marketing campaigns to drive business impact. Key projects include:  
  1. Spearheaded frontend performance optimization, working closely with client-side and cross-functional teams. Implemented container-based preloading, asynchronous tasks, and caching, increasing page transition success rates from 88% to 98% (developed regions) and 60% to 86% (low-network regions).
  2. Developed a performance monitoring dashboard and an intelligent attribution agent, integrating a Webhook API to track key events (e.g., feature launches, frontend version releases). Automated root-cause analysis using event logs, improving fault response efficiency significantly when core metrics fluctuated beyond thresholds.
  3. Optimized the CI pipeline by modularizing projects, enabling build caching, and enhancing Webpack plugins, reducing build time from 45 minutes to 17 minutes.  

##### Douyin (2019‚Äì2022)  
Supported three departments: Open Platform, Creator Middle Platform, and Douyin Search, focusing on full-stack development for middle-end systems. Key projects include:  

  1. Developed a low-code efficiency platform, managing process workflows, compilation, and log transmission. Enabled users to configure Douyin search cards through forms and component libraries, improving R&D efficiency (2021‚Äì2022).
  2. Led the end-to-end development of the Douyin Creator Platform, responsible for frontend architecture, technology selection, core module development, and full-stack CMS support. Grew DAU to over 300,000 within six months (2020‚Äì2021).
  3. Overhauled the Douyin Open Platform website, addressing inefficiencies in documentation generation and SEO. Designed an automation layer using GitLab webhooks and Swagger for real-time API documentation synchronization. Engineered CI/CD pipelines for pre-rendering documentation, auto-updating robots.txt, and improving site navigation, boosting iteration efficiency (2019‚Äì2020).  

#### Ele.me - User Growth (2017‚Äì2019)  
1. Led the Ele.me Super Membership project, developing a backend configuration and delivery system using the Midway framework to integrate downstream HSF services, while extending React as a template engine in preparation for migration.  
2. Developed an SDK for API requests in modular pages, implementing deduplication, throttling, and timing management to enhance the asynchronous module integration experience.  
3. Standardized a UI component library, developed Webpack plugins and build configurations for module packaging, and created CLI tools for project templates and self-signed HTTPS certificate scripts. Maintained a JSBridge aggregation library to integrate multi-end JS SDKs (Ele.me app, Taobao, Alipay, Ele.me Star, etc.), ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.
